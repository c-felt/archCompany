00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.639
my favorite

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:11.639
movies in order of what I think is the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.519
best is really hard to decide

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.480
because I have so many different

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.359
favorite movies and that is what I have

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.000
decided to talk about in my video for my

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.720
website because that is something I can

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.400
definitely talk about for at least a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.519
minute in my top five of my favorite

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.480
movies is definitely Gladiator with

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.879
Russell Crow

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.120
also probably Pacific Rim just such a

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.920
good

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.120
robot uh monster action

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.960
movie um some of the Harry Potters are

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.320
also really really good and also all the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.079
music in those is amazing I'm a very big

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.640
film score fanatic so I love that and

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.000

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.000
minute about my movie tastes
